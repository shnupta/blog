Here is a quick showcase of some of the personal projects I've developed.

## bric
bric is a text editor based on kilo.

bric does not depend on any library (not even curses). It uses fairly standard VT100 (and similar terminals) escape sequences to write and read to and from the terminal.

## Chip-Emul8
Chip-Emul8 was the first emulator I ever wrote. It is written in C and emulates the [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) virtual machine from the 70s.

I actually livestreamed this however the site I did it on is no longer around so the recordings are lost. It was a lot of fun and taught me the basics of computer processors and the execution cycle etc.

I was originally inspired by [Ferris](http://iamferris.com/).
