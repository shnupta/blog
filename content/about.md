I'm currently reading Computer Science at Imperial College London.

I've also been lucky enough to secure a scholarship from [Sintelix](https://www.sintelix.com) where I currently work as a Development Intern, during both term-time and summer, but mostly the latter.

I have many interests within computer science, these range from:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- General AI and Machine Learning
- Financial Trading
- Emulators
- And much more!

Outside of CS, I've a lot of hobbies that I like to juggle with such as mountain biking and playing guitar.

I'm also currently learning Spanish.
