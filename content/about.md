## What am I up to?
I'm currently reading Computer Science at Imperial College London.

## Interests
I have many interests within computer science, these range from:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- General AI and Machine Learning
- Financial Trading
- Emulators
- And much more!

Outside of CS, I've a lot of hobbies that I like to juggle with such as mountain biking and playing guitar.

I'm also currently learning Spanish.

## Reading
Here's a few things that I'm actively reading and researching.

- Minimal-Intelligence Agents for Bargaining Behaviors in Market-Based Environments (Cliff 1997)
  - This is a new area that I recently came across and it's really sparked my interest. This paper is excellently written. I'm intending to do some more research and work once I've finished reading the paper.
  - Dave Cliff has also made a simiple simulation of a limit order book financial exchange open source, you can find it [here](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange).
  - I think it will be a fun project to develop some bots!
- Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
  - A really well known book that I hadn't read yet, and so far I couldn't recommend it enough!
